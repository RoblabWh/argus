# Argus Rewrite

This is a complete rewrite of Argus with the goal of making it more professional, reliable, and maintainable.

**Key Improvements:** 
- The new version will use a **PostgreSQL** database to manage and store reports more robustly.

- The frontend will be rebuilt in **React**, using shadcn/ui to deliver a modern, consistent UI and improved user experience.

- Mapping and other compute-intensive tasks will be moved to separate worker processes, coordinated via Redis for better scalability and modularity.

- The project will continue to use **Docker** to ensure easy installation and deployment, reducing friction for both developers and users.


The goal is to build a more robust and professional codebase, making Argus a future-proof platform thatâ€™s easier to develop, deploy, and extend.
